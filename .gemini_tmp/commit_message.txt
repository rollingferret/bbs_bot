fix: Robust window management during polling loops

- Introduce `_ensure_window_is_ready()` helper for DRY window management.
- Integrate `_ensure_window_is_ready()` into all significant polling loops (e.g., `poll_and_click`, `CHECK_RUN_START`, `RUNNING`, `FINISH` tap/retry loops).
- Ensures continuous re-verification and re-application of 'always on top' status during extended waits.
- Addresses issue where game window could lose focus or move during long polling cycles, as observed in user logs.
